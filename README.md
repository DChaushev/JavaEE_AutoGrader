# JavaEE_AutoGrader
Online judge system

I had a dream for creating such system for some time now.
We're taking a Java EE course at the university and we must present some project at the end.</br>
Perfect occasion for starting developing such a system!

About the system
===
Technologies
---
* Java RESTful with JAX-RS
* MySql with JPA (we had a lot of troubles with that one...)
* HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript for the UI (non of use writes web, so just ignore the crappy code)

Requirements
---
* The system supports two kind of users - administrators and normal users.
* To use the system, you must be a registered user ( a member ).
* Members can submit solutions of the problems in the system, thus gathering points.
* Administrators can add more problems to the system.
